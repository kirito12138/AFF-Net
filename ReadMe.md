Codes for ICPR2020 paper [Adaptive Feature Fusion Network for Gaze Tracking in Mobile Tablets](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9412205/).

The project is based on:

```
numpy==1.20.1
opencv-python==4.2.0.34
torch==1.5.0
torchvision==0.6.0
```

As we conduct experiments on re-face-detected [GazeCapture](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/html/Krafka_Eye_Tracking_for_CVPR_2016_paper.html) dataset, the data-loader codes are not universal with original dataset. Data preparing codes will be released later.
